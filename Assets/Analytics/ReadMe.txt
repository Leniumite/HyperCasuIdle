Import package Analytics from  unity Registry

To use analytics, you need to link the project to Unity dashboard. Do it in  Project Settings => Services.
Link it to an  existing project or create anew  one  from here.

Analytics Manager will automatically send basic event  (game start,end, ...)

To create a  custom event,  go  to  the unity dashboard => Analytics => Event Manager => Add New => Custom Event
Then create custom parameter   you want to use  for this event  in Analytics => Event Manager => Add new => Custom Parameter
Click on your created event and Assign Parameter and select the parameter you created.
